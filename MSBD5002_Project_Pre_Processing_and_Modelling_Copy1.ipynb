about her money and how she fit right in.knowin how i might spend.to make a story short, other than the tight end.had a washington heights friend, who bring that white in.set up a meeting, her dude caught a flight in.sat down at sole, popped a bottle of white then.got straight to business like two corporate white men.the food came, before i could take a bite in.he said \"you the type i usually do not invite in.but since we got a like friend, i could get you like ten\" (ten?).i told him i could move like ten by night s end.put the white over the plate like i am throwin strikes in.el duque, got a dude in the uk, buy five bricks at a time, twotwok.he send the euros, i send the pure dough.now that is the real meaning of a foreign exchange.he smiled, then finished his glass of wine.there is a van outside, pull your sclass behind.my man will pass a dime, at one five a pop.tell shorty \"make the drop, do not make no stops\".i gave him a hand shake, some dollars for the tab.gave shorty the

from my perspective.but with my shorty, a nigga so protective.and should be, she the one who know where the connect live.she do not talk much, real calm and collective.seen something in me because shorty s very selective.i tell her fall back, shorty still will drive.she said the rush of the risk just make her feel alive.i listen at her fuss, sayin that i must.let her do it because it is not too many niggaz that i trust.so now time is flyin, i have been kind of eyein.a ring for my queen, who got me diamond buyin.i am in the g.t., headed up to ct.looking for a stone, light her finger like

get traced in chalk now.but when i get back, we can meet and chit chat.better not be no bullshit, i is not even with that\".now back to what a nigga came out here for.this five carat diamond without near flaw.then head back to the city, call up the committee.get ready for tomorrow, they comin in with fifty.i almost forgot, i got to stop and see a cop.i figured it was a drop, who must is not get his gwap.told them meet me by the bridge, i get there in a hurry.got me worried and it is probably just a minor mix up.he said \"nah lo s , feds done snatched you chick up.caught her at a pick up, scoopin them bricks up.she going to cooperate and a fix up.probably at the headquarters now hangin flicks up\".i asked him \"was he sure?\" shorty s mi amor.this happened to me before with my man diador, over a ki of raw.my nigga got killed, caps got peeled and i still got guilt.he assured me, i was hot, she had put them on me.swore to jesu s  peers that he was here to warn me.normally, i would have just ended her life.but this was the girl that i intended to wife.so i went home to shorty, had trouble sleepin.shorty kind of peepin, my sudden discomfort.she woke up mad early, so i got up with her.got dressed and told her i would hit the spot up with her.she wanted to go alone but a nigga insisted.like \"baby it is been a while and truthfully i missed it\".we rode out but she do not know that i done made a plan.when she hit the spot, close shot, see you later man.i watched her in the building.knowin it is the last time, seein her ass climb in and out of the car.yo i even thought about getting out of the car.but sat back, looking at the ring about to be yours.i let one tear fall at an unfair call.you whole life can change in just one year you all.caught in a thought, then i
